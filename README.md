Date Night Challenge Templates
===

Use this repo as a starting point for your date night campaign. Take a look the branches *denver* and *pdx* to see all the different features we've used in the past.

The content on each subpage (lightbox) can be found in the _content_ folder. 
The majority of the header's, and also the main site navigation uses PNG's... Soooo that's lame. The best way to update those headers/nav items is to open up the PSD and save out a new png. Then make the necessary changes to the CSS.
