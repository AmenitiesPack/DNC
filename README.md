Editing the Content
-------------------

The content on each subpage (lightbox) can be found in the _content_ folder. 
The majority of the header's, and also the main site navigation uses PNG's... Soooo that's lame. The best way to update those headers/nav items is to open up the PSD and save out a new png. Then make the necessary changes to the CSS.


##_Here's a list of the content files that need to be updated:_
- 'about.html'
- 'concierge.html'
- 'contact.html'
